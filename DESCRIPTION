Description: Classification method obtained through linear programming.
    It is advantageous with respect to the classical developments when the distribution of the variables
    involved is unknown or when the number of variables is much greater than the number of individuals.
    Mathematical details behind the method are published in Nueda, et al. (2022) "LPDA: A new classification method based on linear programming".
